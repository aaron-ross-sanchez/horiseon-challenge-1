# horiseon-challenge-1

##Description

In this repository, is updated html and css code from the urban-octo-telegram-main repository. Within that original repository contained code that was not as accessible for screen readers or search engines. I refactored the html and css code to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 

Those changes can be found below in the two different epics:

##HTML

User Story
As a developer,
I want the index.html code to be structured in an accessible way
so that screen the website will be able to reach more users

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN the index.html code
WHEN I view the title tag
THEN I see a descriptive title
WHEN I view li or p tag
THEN they will appear on one line
WHEN an img tag appears
THEN it will be after a h2 tag
WHEN I see a .header class
THEN I will change it to a header tag

THEN I will change it to multiple section tag
WHEN I see an img tag
THEN I will make sure there is an alt attribute
WHEN I see the h2 tag in the footer
THEN I will change it to an h3 tag
WHEN I see the header
THEN I will add a meta tag for a description of the content of the website
WHEN I see the .hero class
THEN I will change it to an article tag
WHEN I see the linked CSS sheet in the head
THEN I will add a reset.css before the style.css
WHEN I see ID's that don't have CSS code
THEN I will delete those ID's
WHEN I see .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost
THEN I will combine them into one class

##CSS

User Story
As a developer,
I want the style.css code to reflect updated HTML code
so that screen the website will be able to reach more users

THEN I will combine them into a new class
WHEN I see .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img
THEN I will combine them into a new class
WHEN I see .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing
THEN I will combine them into a new class
WHEN I see .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img
